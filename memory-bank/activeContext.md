# Active Context: Error Dashboard

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the early prototype phase with development focused on:

1. **UI Polishing**: Fixing CSS and styling issues, particularly related to Tailwind utility classes
2. **Component Structure**: Ensuring all components properly communicate and render data
3. **Data Visualization**: Refining charts and visualizations to most effectively represent error data

## Recent Changes

### CSS Fixes
- Fixed issue with the `border-border` Tailwind utility class causing build failures
- Replaced problematic utility class usage with standard CSS properties for borders
- Ensured consistent styling across components in light and dark themes

### Component Modularization
- Successfully completed the modularization of all components as outlined in the modularization plan
- Broke down the monolithic ErrorDashboard.tsx into smaller, more focused components
- Organized components into logical groups (UI, charts, data display, tabs)

## Current Issues

1. **CSS Implementation**: Some Tailwind utility classes are causing conflicts, requiring more direct CSS approaches
2. **Sample Data Only**: Currently working with generated sample data rather than real OpenSearch data
3. **API Integration Pending**: Connection to OpenSearch API not yet implemented

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Sprint)
1. Complete any remaining CSS fixes to ensure stable UI
2. Begin work on OpenSearch API integration
3. Implement proper error handling for API requests
4. Add loading states for asynchronous operations

### Short-term (1-2 Sprints)
1. Replace sample data with real OpenSearch data
2. Implement real-time or near-real-time updates
3. Add date range selection for more flexible time-based filtering
4. Improve error cascade visualization

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Tab-based Navigation**: Using a tab structure for different views (Summary, Timeline, Errors, Patterns)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Established clear parent-child relationships for data flow
- **Filtering System**: Implemented filtering by category, time, status, and severity
- **Theme Support**: Built with light/dark mode and theme color options

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Card-based Layout**: Using card components to segment and organize information
- **Interactive Charts**: Charts respond to user clicks for filtering
- **Drill-down Flow**: Users can progressively filter down to specific errors
- **Detail Views**: Detailed view available for individual error inspection

### Technical Choices
- **React + TypeScript**: Using TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind + ShadCN**: Using Tailwind for styling with ShadCN components
- **Express Backend**: Planning to use Express for API handling
- **Sample Data Generation**: Currently using utilities to generate realistic sample data

## Integration Points

The main integration point currently being worked toward is the OpenSearch API connection, which will replace the sample data generation system with real-time data from the OpenSearch instance hosted on Digital Ocean.
