# Progress: Error Dashboard

## Project Status

The Error Dashboard project is currently in the **early prototype phase**. The frontend component structure has been established, and we're working with sample data while planning the OpenSearch API integration.

## What Works

### Core Dashboard Structure
- ✅ Main application layout with header, sidebar, and content area
- ✅ Tab-based navigation system
- ✅ Theme system with light/dark mode and color options
- ✅ Component modularization complete

### Data Visualization
- ✅ Error categories bar chart
- ✅ Severity distribution pie chart
- ✅ Error timeline line chart
- ✅ Error volume bar chart
- ✅ HTTP status pie chart
- ✅ Error categories vertical bar chart

### Data Display Components
- ✅ Most common errors table
- ✅ Root cause analysis table
- ✅ Error examples list
- ✅ Cascade failures view
- ✅ Error pattern analysis view
- ✅ Error detail view
- ✅ Filtered errors list
- ✅ Critical timeline

### Filtering System
- ✅ Filter by category
- ✅ Filter by time period
- ✅ Filter by status code
- ✅ Filter by severity
- ✅ Active filters display
- ✅ Filter reset functionality

### Data Handling
- ✅ Sample data generation utilities
- ✅ Data processing and transformation functions
- ✅ Filter utility functions
- ✅ Chart configuration utilities

## In Progress

### UI & CSS
- 🔄 Fixing CSS styling issues
- 🔄 Resolving Tailwind utility class conflicts
- 🔄 Optimizing responsive layout

### Data Flow Refinement
- 🔄 Improving state management for complex filters
- 🔄 Enhancing chart interactivity
- 🔄 Optimizing component render performance

## What's Left to Build

### Backend Integration
- ❌ Express server setup
- ❌ OpenSearch API connection
- ❌ API endpoint implementation
- ❌ Authentication handling

### Real Data Implementation
- ❌ Replace sample data with real OpenSearch data
- ❌ Implement data transformation for API responses
- ❌ Add pagination for large datasets
- ❌ Implement real-time or periodic data refresh

### Error Handling
- ❌ API error handling
- ❌ Fallback UI for failed data fetches
- ❌ Error boundary implementation
- ❌ Retry mechanisms

### Additional Features
- ❌ Date range selection
- ❌ Advanced filtering options
- ❌ Saved filters/views
- ❌ Export functionality
- ❌ User preferences persistence

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for components
- ❌ Integration tests
- ❌ API mocks for testing
- ❌ Performance testing

## Known Issues

### Current Issues
1. Tailwind utility class conflicts (some recently fixed, others pending)
2. Some chart responsiveness issues on smaller screens
3. Tab switching occasionally causes brief layout flicker
4. Sample data lacks the complexity of real logs

### Technical Debt
1. Some components could benefit from further decomposition
2. Need to implement proper loading states for async operations
3. Filter logic could be extracted to custom hooks
4. Missing accessibility considerations

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
1. Complete CSS fixes
2. Begin Express server setup
3. Design OpenSearch API connection strategy

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Implement basic OpenSearch connection
2. Replace sample data with real data for main views
3. Add error handling for API requests
4. Implement date range selection

### Long-term
1. Add user preferences and saved views
2. Implement alerting functionality
3. Add annotation capabilities
4. Extend dashboard with additional visualization types
5. Add export and reporting features

## Deployment Readiness

The application is not yet ready for production deployment. The following items need to be addressed before initial deployment:

1. Complete OpenSearch API integration
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states and indicators
4. Perform performance optimization
5. Establish deployment pipeline
