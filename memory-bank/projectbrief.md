# Project Brief: Error Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Error Dashboard is an application designed to pull logs from OpenSearch and display them in a clean, visual format through charts and visualizations. It serves as a comprehensive logging dashboard that provides error notifications, error cascade analysis, timelines, and other visualization tools.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal
Create a dashboard application that connects to a hosted OpenSearch database on Digital Ocean and presents log data in an intuitive, visual manner that makes error analysis faster and more effective.

### Key Features
- **Error Visualization**: Display error logs using various chart types (bar charts, pie charts, line charts)
- **Timeline Analysis**: Show errors over time to identify patterns and spikes
- **Error Categories**: Categorize and filter errors by type, severity, and status
- **Cascade Failure Detection**: Identify and visualize cascade failures where one error leads to others
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Tools to help identify the root causes of errors
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Advanced filtering to focus on specific error types, time periods, or severities

### User Experience Goals
- Clean, intuitive interface that makes complex log data easily understandable
- Fast loading and responsive design that works on various devices
- Easy-to-use filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Clear visualizations that highlight important patterns and issues

## Technical Scope

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- ShadCN UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart libraries for data visualization

### Backend
- Express server to handle API requests
- Connection to OpenSearch API

### Data Source
- OpenSearch database hosted on Digital Ocean

## Development Status
The project is currently in early prototype stage with the frontend component architecture established. The application is using sample data for development while the OpenSearch API integration is pending.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully retrieve and parse log data from OpenSearch
- Accurately visualize error patterns and relationships
- Provide actionable insights through the dashboard interface
- Enable users to identify and resolve errors more quickly than through raw log analysis
